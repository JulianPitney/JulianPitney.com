            <h3>Project Description</h3>
			<p>I decided to do this because I kept hearing about neural nets in various media. They sounded cool and I wanted to know how they worked.
			The majority of this project was reading and trying to understand the architecture and math involved. Figuring out gradient descent and
			how it works together with back propagation to facilitate the network's learning was tricky. I'm going to gloss over the architecture for now,
			as it's (relatively) simple and there's a diagram summing it up to the left. I'll instead focus on explaining gradient descent, as that's the meat
			of this project.</p>
			<h3>Gradient Descent</h3>
			<p>Neural nets work by defining an error function that compares the actual output of the network to the
			desired output of the network. The goal is to minimize this error function. Gradient descent works by findinding the partial derivative of the error function with respect to each variable that the error function depends on. 
			These derivatives give the rate of change of the error function with respect to each variable, showing you whether you need to increase or decrease 
			that variable in order to reduce the value of the error function (This increase or decrease is done in small increments, once each iteration, to avoid overshooting 
			the adjustments). The complex part is that nested within the error function is the output of
			the network, and the output of the network is itself a composite function consisting of the activation function of every node in the network
			(which are all linked together and feeding forward into each other). So the error function is a composite of hundreds to thousands of functions, which makes 
			finding it's partial derivatives tricky. In addition to that, you have to find the partial derivative of the error function once for every variable in that function (which includes every weight and
			bias in every layer of the network). Only then can you update all the weights and biases in the correct direction, reducing the overall error for that input.
			This whole procedure is repeated once for every training input (I used the MNIST data set, which contains 50,000 training samples, which is small comapared to real world applications).
			It's effectively a hyper efficient way to minimize a function with thousands or even millions of variables. This explains why deep-learning
			is so computationally expensive, it is however, many orders of magnitude more efficient than other optimization methods. This allows us to optimize very large and complex
			functions that depend on millions of parameters, which is a primitive form of learning.</p>
			<h3>Implementation</h3>
			<p>After figuring out all of the above (which took awhile), I understood everything well enough to write everything from scratch in C++.
			I tried to build everything in a modular and easy to use way. I took advantage of C++'s polymorphism features (type compatibility between parent and child
			class pointers and virtual functions) to build a nice interface between the neural net and data acquisition modules, allowing different data formats to be easily used
			for training and benchmarking. The end result was a single function to generate a neural net, another function for training it, and a third function
			for benchmarking. All of which are configurable through function parameters and global variables. I played around with trying to parralelize some of the
			functions that take up a lot of cycles, but never managed to get that working correctly.</p>
			<p>I tested the finished product using the MNIST data set, which consists of 60,000 images of hand-written digits (0-9). My network correctly identified around
			98% of the test data after being trained on the training data. This was a tough project but it felt really good seeing it all working correctly. And understanding in detail 
			how neural nets work is pretty cool too.</p>
