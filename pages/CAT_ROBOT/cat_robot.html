                <h3>Why are we doing robotic surgery on mice?</h3>
				<p>Neuroscience researchers use mice to study stroke. We use these animals to test new treatments that we hope will one day improve 
                   (or prevent) stroke outcomes in human patients. When experimenting with a new treatment, you want to control as many 
                   variables as possible so that it's easy to tell what affect your treatment is having. If one group of mice with strokes has
                   much better outcomes than another group of mice with strokes, and the only other difference between them is your treatment, then
                   you can prove your treatment is working. </p>

                <p>One variable that's important to control when studying stroke treatments is the location and size/severity of the stroke itself.
                   A common method for achieving this is perfusing the brain's vasculature network with a photosensitive dye and then shining a laser 
                   on the part of the brain where stroke is desired. The laser light striking the dye causes the dye to congeal and plug the 
                   blood vessels. This causes a stroke. By carefully controlling where the laser shines and the shape and intensity of the beam,
                   researchers have very fine control of the stroke variable in their experiments.
                   
                <p>How do you get access to their brains? The surgical procedure is called a craniotomy. From Wikipedia: "A craniotomy is a surgical 
                   operation in which a bone flap is temporarily removed from the skull to access the brain." This is a common procedure
                   performed by surgical technicians all over the world. Automating this procedure for low cost would provide a big productivity
                   boost to pre-clinical research. It would also improve data quality by increasing the accuracy and precision of craniotomies.</p>

                <p>Our goal was to get a proof of concept working to see if mouse craniotomies could be automated for a reasonable price.
                
                <h3>Method (High-Level Steps)</h3>
                <p>
                    Our solution relies on shining a laser beam onto the target area and recording the reflected light with a camera. 
                    The laser light will be reflected onto a region of the sensor that differs depending on the height of the surface the beam is reflecting off of.
                    Since this target-height:beam-translation ratio is constant, it's straightforward to calibrate and then use this information to calculate the height of 
                    a point on the target relative to some set 0 point. The 0 point is determined by using the metal drillbit as a capacitive sensor and touching the drillbit
                    to the top of the skull. 
                    

                    <ol>
                        <li>The Arduino first instructs the CNC machine to lower the drillbit until it makes contact with the skull. When contact with the skull is made, this point is set as z=0. </li>
                        <li>The laserlight then turns on and shines it's beam across the target.</li>
                        <li>The camera grabs a frame.</li>
                        <li>The CNC machine moves the toolhead a small amount.</li>
                        <li>Repeat until we have a scan of the skull's surface.</li>
                        <li>OpenCV is then used to extract the laser lines in each frame and map the relevant pixels onto XYZ coordinates in our coordinate space. </li>
                        <li>The output of the above step is a point cloud of the skull's surface.</li>
                        <li>This point cloud is then run through MeshLab to generate a 3D model of the skull's surface.</li>
                        <li>This 3D model is then fed into Fusion 360 to generate a toolpath for the CNC machine to follow.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Yep. You can do an automated craniotomy for about $1000 in parts. Obviously our implementation is really rough and 
                    there's a lot of room for improvement. But with some development time and a little money we could design something 
                    that would do an excellent job for this specific procedure in mice.
