                <h3>Project Description:</h3>
                <p>This project was something I set up out of necessity. I found myself going to a lot of trouble to watch video content that didn't come from Netflix. This often involved hooking up a laptop to my TV and moving several cables around or having to transfer content to a USB which under certain circumstances wouldn't work on my aging PS3.</p>
				<p>Because a friend from work had just told me about his success with Plex and I had also just bought a fancy new "RT-AC87U Dual-band 4x4 AC2400 Wifi 4-port Gigabit Router", I decided a media server was probably the best solution to my problem.</p>
				<p>I installed Fedora on a desktop I had lying around and got the Plex Media Server running on it successfully after a few hours of tinkering. After getting the Plex server+client configured properly it was time to test. I took one of the nicer looking/sounding Blu-Ray titles I had lying around (Prometheus) and began ripping it to the server. Because Blu-Ray content is encoded with H.264 I decided to leave the files in this format (This produces very large files but preserves quality and I figured my new router was up to the task).</p>
				<p>I was still unsure whether streaming over Wifi at such a high bit-rate (20-30MB/s) would be an issue but decided to leave my clients (PS3+PC) unplugged. After a little more tinkering the stream was working over the air in glorious (almost) full Blu-Ray quality! Over the next few months i'll be importing content to the server and improving my library. Now I enjoy high quality content on whatever device is most convenient and there's no effort involved (exactly how watching video should be).</p>
